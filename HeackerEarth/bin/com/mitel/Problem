JP and Strings
Max. Marks 100
A 1-character string is which consists of only one letter 'a', 2-character string consists of only letters 'a' and 'b'. Similarly 26-character string consists of all the small letters in alphabet i.e from 'a' to 'z'. 
A string is valid if there is no character in the string which has the same position as in the alphabetical sequence.
For example, string "bac" is not valid because the character 'c' is at the position 3 in the string(Consider string and alphabets both as 1-indexed) which is same as in the alphabetical sequence. Whereas string "cab" is valid.
Now there is a function F(N , L) such that,

F(N , L) = Number of valid N-Character strings of length L.

Input:
The first line will contain the number of queries Q. Next Q lines will contain two space separated integers containing N and L.

Output:
For every query print a single line containing the value of the function F(N , L). Answer may be too large so print it modulo 1000000007.

Constraints:
1 <= Q <= 10^3
1 <= N <= 26
1 <= L <= 10^9

Explanation
For the third case, 3-character valid strings of length 2 are "ba", "bc", "ca" and "cc".
